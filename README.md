# Isoplan plugin

Isoplan is a live view of every agent working across a team, drawn as an office floor. This repo holds the open part of it: the Claude Code plugin that streams each session's facts to a team's office server, and the wire protocol between them. Both are MIT, so anyone can check exactly what runs on their machine and what it sends.

The office server and the floor are a separate, proprietary product.

## Install the plugin

This repo is a Claude Code plugin marketplace. In Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add adamlinscott/isoplan-plugin
/plugin install isoplan@isoplan
```

Then point it at your office server: set `server` in `~/.claude/isoplan/config.json`, for example `{ "server": "wss://your-office.example/data-layer" }`. Any key in that file overrides the plugin's defaults in `packages/mod/config.json`.

## What leaves your machine

By default only facts: which sessions and agents are running and what kind of work each is doing, in which repository and branch, which files they touched, and when they wait. Session-derived text leaves only in named cases, each kept by the server for a set period and then deleted: an agent's final report, questions an agent asks its owner, and the questions, answers and briefs in a room that was handed over.

## What is here

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `packages/mod/` | The Claude Code plugin. Its bundle in `dist/` is committed, so the plugin runs from a checkout with no install step; rebuild it with every change to `src/`. |
| `packages/protocol/` | The wire protocol, published to npm as [`@isoplan/protocol`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@isoplan/protocol). |
| `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | The marketplace listing. |

## Develop

Needs Node 22.13+ and pnpm.

```
pnpm install
pnpm build        # protocol to dist/, plugin bundle to packages/mod/dist/
pnpm test
pnpm sweep        # run the repo sweep from the built plugin
pnpm isoplan-install / pnpm isoplan-uninstall
```

To release the protocol, bump `packages/protocol/package.json`'s version and run `pnpm publish` in `packages/protocol`.

Earlier history of both packages is in Isoplan's private repository.
