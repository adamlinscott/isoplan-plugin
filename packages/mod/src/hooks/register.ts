// Isoplan's hooks module: Claude Code loads it through hooks/hooks.json. It draws nothing. The
// machine's runner reports the session (ADR 0007); this module does only what has to run inside
// Claude Code, and reaches the runner through its end of the runner's local pipe (dist/pipe.js,
// src/pipe), which it starts for the session and keeps running: Claude Code gives a hooks module no
// sockets of its own. "The data layer" below is the runner reporting the session, whose lines come
// through that pipe. It shows the link
// to each office in one status line, by the office's label (`Isoplan: internal ✓ · dev ✓`, #105),
// leaving out an office that doesn't take the repo, with "Isoplan updated: type /reload-plugins" beside it once the data layer says
// a newer version of the plugin is on disk (src/update), writes the room titles the data layer asks for on the owner's own login,
// and adds the office server's conflict notes to the agent's next tool result. When the office
// server wants the machine paired, a "Pair this machine" link is in the status line while it waits,
// and in the transcript once per session start, so nobody types a command or is nagged.
//
// It also gives the session's agent the ask_room tool (#49), once the office server says this
// session may ask its room (an `ask-rights` line): the session took a handoff, and its owner hasn't
// turned asking off. With rights from more than one office it asks in the office the session took its
// handoff through, else in the first of them in config.json's order (dist/ask.js decides). A tool can't be taken away again, so once the rights go (turned off, the
// handoff dismissed, another session id) it answers that asking is off, without running anything. The tool asks the room's lead a question through the office server
// (dist/ask.js, which asks through the runner), with no one typing anything; the script waits only as long as runner.json says,
// then tells the agent to carry on. The end of a question that comes after that arrives as an
// `asked` line and is kept until it goes on a tool result of the agent that asked, or of the lead
// once that agent has stopped; only then is it acked
// (dist/ask.js --ack), so the server sends it again until it has been shown, and one shown already
// is only acked again. Answers are labelled as another person's session and quoted (ask/text.ts).
//
// An agent's question to its owner (AskUserQuestion) is in the terminal and on the floor at once,
// and the first answer wins (#50): the call goes ahead at once, so its dialog shows, while the hook
// waits for an answer from the floor too. One that comes first answers the call in the dialog's
// place, which closes it: the agent reads the answers as the tool's own result, as if they had been
// picked in the terminal. One answered in the terminal first just ends the wait. Nothing times out:
// the terminal has the question all along. Each wait is marked in a file in the folder the data
// layer's `waits` line names, so the data layer offers the question to the floor only while this
// hook really waits for it: not one asked before the plugin loaded, nor one this hook never saw.
//
// The pipe's end passes the runner's JSON lines on on its stdout (src/lines.ts). Claude Code closes
// the child's stdin at launch, so what goes the other way, a title, goes through a file the line
// names, which the runner reads. While the runner can't be reached (a `runner` line, `down`) the
// status line says the session isn't reaching the office until it is back, or why the runner won't
// start (`held`); the pipe's end starts the runner and tries again, and the runner reports the session afresh once it is through. A pipe's
// end that ends is started again, backing off while it keeps failing; one running for a session
// id the process has left (a /clear, a resume) is started again for the new id. It passes the
// time this module started (`--since`), so the hooks module of a window that started later wins the
// session. Once this copy's folder has gone (Claude Code cleans up a version some time after an
// update), nothing is started again, and the status line asks for /reload-plugins. One told that
// another has the session (a `superseded` line: a newer version's after a reload, another
// window's, or an earlier version's data layer still running for it) is started again only SUPERSEDED_RECHECK_MS later, and goes on if the session
// is free by then.
//
// The session's context window, the size Claude Code gives the status line (`context_window_size`,
// through $.session.usage), goes to the data layer through the file its `window` line names, as it
// starts and on each tool call once it has changed (a /model switch), for the session's facts.
//
// A message the owner sends the session from the floor (#77) comes as an `owner-message` line, and
// is submitted with $.prompt.submit as a turn of its own, read as the owner's own words: once the
// session is idle, after any message before it, never touching the draft in the prompt box. Only a
// Claude Code build that has $.prompt.submit (SUBMIT_SINCE on, by $.session.version) starts the pipe's
// end with `--messages`, so only its session says on the floor that it takes messages. Whether each
// went in, or waits its turn (it hasn't gone in after SUBMIT_WAIT_MS), or why not, goes back through
// the file the line names. One for a session id the process has left (a /clear) is not submitted.
