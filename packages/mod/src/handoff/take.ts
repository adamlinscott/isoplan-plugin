// Taking a handoff from the floor (#48): the receiver's runner does it, in order.
//
// 1. The clone: the machine's Claude Code sessions from the last `cloneSearchDays` say which folders
//    the receiver works in. Each is placed with git, newest first, and the main checkout of the first
//    whose remote is the handoff's (the same project id, or the same path for a local remote) is the
//    clone. Without one nothing can be made, so no session opens and the handoff stays to be taken.
// 2. The worktree: a sibling of the clone, <clone>-handoff-<id>, on isoplan/handoff/<id>, tracking
//    the remote's branch, made and moved with the repo's hooks off (they are the sender's, from the
//    branch). One made for this handoff before moves to the branch as handed over now, unless it
//    holds work that isn't in it: uncommitted changes to tracked files, or any commit that is neither
//    in the new tip nor one of the commits this machine took of this handoff before (taken.json in
//    the handoff's folder). Then it is left as it is and the take is refused with a note. A local
//    branch is never reset over such commits.
// 3. The setup script (E11): `worktreeSetup` in isoplan.json at the repo's top, read from the
//    receiver's own copy of the remote's default branch, and never from any other branch, so neither
//    the handoff nor whatever the clone has checked out can change what runs. When the default branch
//    can't be told, setup is skipped and the meeting says why. It runs with the system shell (cmd.exe
//    on Windows, /bin/sh on a Mac) in the worktree, hidden, with ISOPLAN_HANDOFF_ID and
//    ISOPLAN_HANDOFF_BRANCH set, under its timeout. Its output goes to setup.log in the handoff's
//    folder.
// 4. The repos under the session's folder (#56), each at its path in the worktree, parents first.
//    One there already (the setup script's clone, say) with the handoff's remote is fetched and
//    switched to the handoff's branch, by the shortcut's rules below: never over uncommitted changes
//    to tracked files or commits of the receiver's own. Where there is none, or only an empty
//    folder, it is cloned from the recorded remote on that branch, only when that is an https, ssh
//    or host:path remote (never a local path, file:// or a \server share), with Git LFS's download
//    off. A path through a link, or into a .git folder by any name Windows gives one, is refused.
//    The setup script runs before this, so it sees only the repos it clones itself. One that fails is reported with its path, and the rest go on.
//    A handoff from a folder that isn't a repo itself (a plain folder above several) has no
//    worktree to make: its folder is a new plain folder, <workspace>-handoff-<id>, beside the
//    receiver's own workspace, which is the most recent session folder holding a clone of one of
//    its repos at that repo's path. There is no repo there to read isoplan.json from, so no setup
//    script runs.
// 5. Claude Code in the worktree, under the session id the server chose, so that session alone may
//    join the room, told to read the brief, which is in brief.md in the handoff's folder
//    (<claude dir>/isoplan/handoffs/<id>/). A spin-off's task (#91) is in task.md there, and the
//    session is told to read that first. As the receiver chose on the floor, and only as they
//    said: a handoff that doesn't say is refused.
//    - `terminal`: a terminal window, the only thing here that opens one, and only for that click
//      (Windows: `start`, a Windows Terminal tab where that is the default; Mac: Terminal.app);
//    - `headless`: a background session, `claude --bg`, with no window. Claude Code starts one only
//      in a folder it trusts, and a new worktree isn't, so the worktree's path alone is recorded as
//      trusted in .claude.json first: the floor told the receiver it would be. The session is
//      confirmed through `claude agents --json`; the receiver opens it with `claude attach`, and a
//      harness that shows the repo's worktrees (Orca, for example) finds the worktree.
//    - `orca`: in the receiver's own Orca app (orca.ts), the one other path that shows anything, and
//      only for that click. The clone is added to Orca when it isn't there. A worktree new to this
//      machine is made by Orca, `orca worktree create` on the handoff's branch from the remote's,
//      with Orca's own setup skipped, so it is one of Orca's in the repo's Orca workspace; one made
//      before, a local branch of the handoff's name, or a clone whose core.hooksPath is set (whose
//      hooks could be the handoff branch's own, and Orca's checkout doesn't turn them off) gets the
//      take's own worktree instead, which Orca finds by its path. The worktree is trusted as for
//      headless, then `orca terminal create` opens a terminal in it that runs the launcher. Neither
//      the worktree nor the terminal is brought to the front: Orca's view changes only when the
//      receiver clicks Focus this session on the floor (focus.ts), which is why the terminal's handle
//      and the worktree are kept in orca.json in the handoff's folder.
//      Without Orca's CLI nothing is made, and the take says so; nor for a handoff of a plain folder
//      above several repos, which Orca can't hold.
//    - `desktop`: in the Claude app, which runs its own Claude Code and opens a session of Claude
//      Code for the terminal's with `claude --desktop --resume <id>` (2.1.285 on, a Mac or Windows
//      x64, signed in with a Claude subscription). The OS, the binary's version and its sign-in
//      (`claude auth status`, which must answer, and say a subscription) are checked before anything
//      is made. The worktree is trusted as for headless, then the take's prompt runs to its end,
//      hidden, as a saved session under the server's id (`claude -p --permission-mode default`, so no
//      `defaultMode` in the branch's settings loosens it, under `desktopReadMaxTurns` and
//      `desktopReadTimeoutMinutes`), so it has read the brief before the app takes it over and the two
//      never write to it at once. A first turn that fails has its transcript deleted. Then, unless the
//      server has dropped the take (cancelled, or timed out) or it has run past
//      `desktopTakeBudgetMinutes` (kept under the server's own take timeout), the app is asked to open
//      it. A session the app didn't open is still taken, with the failure saying how to open it.
//      The first turn's process is in the process registry while it runs (runner/registry.ts).
//    - `driven` (protocol 0.5.0): a session driven from the floor, run by the runner's session driver
//      (runner/session.ts). Only for the runner's own person (`by`), checked before anything is made.
//      The worktree and setup are as for a terminal, and the worktree is trusted as for headless;
//      then the driver checks its cap and readies the session, which it opens once `taken` has been
//      handed to the link (which sends it now, or after the next hello), under the take's session id,
//      with the take's prompt as its first instruction, and the permission mode the person asked for
//      (`permissions`), which the driver runs only where the office allows it. A take the server has
//      dropped (cancelled, or timed out) by then isn't trusted or readied.
//
// Step 5 for every mode but driven is openSession, which a new session from the floor opened outside
// it uses too (runner/start-where.ts), with its own words.
//
// After Orca (for a take into Orca), the claude binary is looked for, in every mode, before anything
// is made: without it nothing is.
//
// A failed setup script or repo checkout doesn't stop the rest: the session still opens, and the step is reported
// with the end of its output. Output leaves the machine only after the secret scan.
