// Keeping the plugin up to date (#96). The plugin's version is pinned in plugin.json, and a release
// is a bump of it: Claude Code installs a new copy only when that version changes. A session's data
// layer runs this as it starts and every `updateCheckHours`, hidden and in the background:
//
// - it turns on Claude Code's own auto-update for the plugin's marketplace, by setting
//   `"autoUpdate": true` on the marketplace's entry under `extraKnownMarketplaces` in the user's
//   settings.json, a documented setting, which `claude plugin marketplace add` writes. Only an entry
//   that is there, with a source and no `autoUpdate` of its own, is changed: a person who turned it
//   off keeps it off, and no entry or source is ever made up. update.json records that the plugin
//   turned it on, so uninstall takes out only that (install.ts). Claude Code's own records
//   (known_marketplaces.json and the rest) are never written.
// - it runs `claude plugin marketplace update <marketplace>`, then `claude plugin update <id>
//   --scope <scope>` for each install installed_plugins.json records (in its project's folder for a
//   project or local one), which put the version the marketplace offers in Claude Code's plugin
//   cache if it is newer. A running session keeps the version it loaded until /reload-plugins, which
//   the status line asks for (state.ts, `newestDataLayer`).
//
// The commands run with no window and no shell, never prompting: git with no terminal prompt, no
// credential manager window, an askpass that answers nothing and ssh in batch mode; without the
// variables that tie a process to the session that started it; and stopped with everything they
// started if they run past COMMAND_TIMEOUT_MS.
//
// One check runs at a time on the machine (update.lock), and update.json records when the last one
// started: a check is skipped when any session on the machine started one within its floor, which
// is START_GAP_MS for the check a session makes as it starts and `updateCheckHours` for the timed
// ones, so the machine checks about once per interval however many sessions are open. Nothing runs
// when DISABLE_UPDATES, DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER or CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC is set, as
// with Claude Code's own plugin auto-update, unless FORCE_AUTOUPDATE_PLUGINS is set too. A data
// layer outside the plugin cache (a checkout, --plugin-dir, a marketplace added from a local folder,
// which loads in place) has nothing to update, and its caller doesn't run this.
