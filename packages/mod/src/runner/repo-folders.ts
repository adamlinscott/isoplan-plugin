// Where on this machine a new session can start from the floor (#67, isoplan-app#182): each repo the
// office takes that Claude Code sessions here ran in, once, by its main checkout (#84), with the
// branches on its remote. The runner's driver sends the list as a `folders` message (session.ts),
// and a start naming a folder, or a branch, is opened only in one it listed.
//
// A folder a session ran in counts for its repo's main checkout (checkouts.ts): a worktree, even one
// since deleted, finds its repo's checkout, so a repo worked on only in worktrees is offered. A folder
// git can't place counts as itself. The checkout counts for the repo a session there reports as
// (data-layer/home.ts approvedHome): its repo, or, for a folder above several repos, the first the
// office takes. One that is gone, or in no repo the office takes, isn't listed. The checkout and
// each branch pass the secret scan before they may leave the machine; one it matches, or one longer
// than the protocol takes, is left out, never cut.
