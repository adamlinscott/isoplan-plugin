// A new session from the floor that opens outside it (#85): a start with a `mode` other than
// `driven`, which session.ts has checked (its person, its folder, its branch) before it comes here.
//
// - The folder: for Orca, the checkout when there is no branch or it is on it, else a worktree Orca
//   makes in the repo's Orca workspace (checkouts.ts orcaBranchFolder); for the rest, the folder the
//   runner offers for the branch, as for a driven start (checkouts.ts branchFolder).
// - It opens as a take does (handoff/take.ts openSession), under a fresh session id, with the typed
//   task its first message and nothing from any room: a terminal window, the person's own pick; a
//   background session; a terminal in Orca; or the Claude app, its first turn run hidden first.
// - The task goes on Claude Code's command line as it is, unless it can't safely: one that starts
//   with `-` would be read as an option, and on Windows a terminal runs it from a .cmd launcher, where
//   a quote or a line break would end the argument and a `\` at its end would escape the closing
//   quote, and cmd.exe can't run a line much over 8,000 characters, so a long task can't go there
//   either. Such a task is written to task.md in the start's own folder (<claude dir>/isoplan/starts/
//   <session>/, which holds the launcher too), which is added to the session, and the first message
//   says to read it.
// - For the Claude app the task is always in task.md: its hidden first turn runs with no one to
//   approve what it does, so it only reads the task and says how it will go about it, and the work
//   itself runs in the app, which asks the person as it goes.
