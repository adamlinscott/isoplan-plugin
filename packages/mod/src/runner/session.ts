// The session driver (#41, design R1, R3, R5, R8): a person's own Claude Code session, run by the
// runner on their machine and driven from the floor through the office server (protocol 0.5.0's
// `drive` requests and `driven` messages, packages/protocol/src/messages.ts).
//
//   claude -p (--resume <uuid> | --session-id <uuid>) --input-format stream-json
//     --output-format stream-json --verbose --permission-mode (auto | bypassPermissions)
//     --permission-prompts host --permission-prompt-tool stdio [--name <name>] [--add-dir <folder>]
//
// - One long-lived process per held session, on the answerer's pattern (claude.ts), but this is the
//   person's own working session: their settings, tools, MCP servers and plugins load, and it is
//   saved, so the plugin's own hooks show it on the floor as their agent. Its environment is the
//   runner's less what ties a process to the session that started the runner (forkEnv).
// - Probed on Claude Code 2.1.318 (6 Nov 2026, Haiku, a temp folder): one process takes turn after
//   turn while stdin stays open; each user line starts a turn (a `system` `init` line first, about
//   0.6 s after the line is written), and each turn ends with exactly one `result`, `num_turns` ≥ 1,
//   `result` the agent's last words. Closing stdin ends the process, exit code 0, within a second.
//   `--resume <uuid>` keeps the same session id (no fork). A missing transcript writes "No
//   conversation found with session ID: <uuid>" to stderr and a `result` with `is_error`,
//   `subtype` "error_during_execution", `num_turns` 0 and that text in `errors`, then exits 1. A tool
//   use comes as an `assistant` line with a `tool_use` block, its result as a `user` line with a
//   `tool_result` block. Something that needs permission, with nobody answering, is denied at once:
//   a `system` line, `subtype` "permission_denied", naming `tool_name`, then an error tool result,
//   whether `--permission-prompts` is the default `host` or `none`.
// - Probed on Claude Code 2.1.318 (6 Nov 2026, Haiku, a temp folder, --no-session-persistence, no
//   settings files, `echo hi > probe.txt` through Bash): `--permission-prompts host` alone still
//   denies at once as above (`permission_decision` source "config"); with `--permission-prompt-tool
//   stdio` as well, the prompt comes to the runner instead, after the `assistant` line with the
//   `tool_use`, as one line: `{"type":"control_request","request_id":"<uuid>","request":{"subtype":
//   "can_use_tool","tool_name":"Bash","display_name":"Bash","input":{"command":"echo hi > probe.txt",
//   "description":"Write hi into probe.txt"},"description":"Write hi into probe.txt",
//   "permission_suggestions":[...],"blocked_path":"<the file>","tool_use_id":"toolu_..."}}`. It
//   waits for as long as it takes (90 s and more, Claude Code sets no limit). The answer is one stdin
//   line: `{"type":"control_response","response":{"subtype":"success","request_id":"<its id>",
//   "response":{"behavior":"allow","updatedInput":<its input>}}}` runs the tool (the file was made),
//   and `"response":{"behavior":"deny","message":"<words>"}` doesn't: the tool's result is an error
//   whose text is the message, and the turn goes on, with no `permission_denied` line. An interrupt
//   while one waits makes Claude Code send `{"type":"control_cancel_request","request_id":"<its
//   id>"}`, then end the turn with an error `result` (`subtype` "error_during_execution"). Closing
//   stdin while one waits aborts it ("Tool permission stream closed before response received" as the
//   tool's error result) and the turn goes on to its end. In `auto` mode the same holds: a prompt
//   comes only for what auto mode would still ask (an `ask` rule in the settings, `decision_reason_
//   type` "rule"), and a `deny` rule still gives the `permission_denied` line, as Claude Code's own
//   denial. `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` is taken (`init` says `permissionMode`
//   "bypassPermissions") and ran the write with no prompt.
// - Probed on Claude Code 2.1.318 (6 Nov 2026, Haiku, a temp folder, --no-session-persistence): an
//   instruction that is one of Claude Code's own commands, such as `/cost`, runs no turn of the
//   model's. It gives a `system` `init` line, an `assistant` line with `local_command_source` and
//   the command's text, then one `result`: `subtype` "success", `is_error` false, `num_turns` 0,
//   `local_command` "cost", and that text in `result`. The next instruction runs as usual. So a
//   result with `local_command` ends the turn too, though its `num_turns` is 0.
// - A start opens a new session (--session-id, a fresh uuid) in the folder of the first of the
//   room's sessions this machine has its own record of: Claude Code's transcript of that session
//   says the folder it ran in (`office.folder`, which also needs the folder to be there and in a
//   repo the office takes). Never a path from the server. None: refused `no-folder`.
// - Where a new session can start (#67): with each connection's first drive-policy, after
//   `holding`, and again whenever a check every `repoFoldersCheckMinutes` finds it changed, the
//   office is sent `folders`, the folders sessions on this machine ran in for each repo it takes
//   (`office.repoFolders`, repo-folders.ts). A start with `folder` and no room opens a fresh session
//   there, in a room of its own (`room:<session>`), with nothing from any room passed in, only when
//   the folder is one the office was last told of for the start's project and is still in that repo
//   (`office.home`); otherwise it is refused `no-folder`. The server's path is checked against
//   what this runner listed, never used unchecked.
// - From #84 each repo is listed once, by its main checkout, with the branches on its remote
//   (repo-folders.ts, checkouts.ts), and the check runs at least every `branchRefreshMinutes`, so
//   the office's list stays current. A start with `branch` too is refused `no-folder` unless that
//   branch was listed for the repo; it opens in the checkout when the checkout is on that branch, and
//   otherwise in a worktree of it (`office.branchFolder`), never switching the checkout's branch.
// - A start with a `mode` other than `driven` (#85), in a folder listed as above and on a branch
//   listed for it, opens there as a take does (start-where.ts, handoff/take.ts openSession), with
//   its instruction the first message and nothing from any room; it is answered `opened` with the
//   session's id and room, or `refused` `unavailable` with why. Its `permissions` and the cap don't
//   count: the runner doesn't hold it, and its own data layer reports it to the floor.
// - A turn is named by the instruction that started it; one at a time (`busy`). Each tool use is
//   sent as `tool` with a short summary of what for; the turn's `result` text as `reply`; then
//   `turn-ended`. The turn's full output (instruction, the agent's words, tools and their results) is
//   kept in memory for `output`; the whole session's comes from its transcript on disk.
// - Held: while a process holds the session (registry.ts records it). `stop` ends the process at
//   once, mid-turn or not; `hand-back` closes stdin and gives it `drivenCloseSeconds` to finish by
//   itself, then ends it, and answers with `claude --resume <uuid>` and the folder: the session is
//   the person's again and is forgotten here. A process that still hasn't closed after that (or,
//   for a stop, KILL_WAIT_MS after it was ended) keeps the session held, and the request is refused
//   `unavailable`, to try again. A process with no turn running and no output for
//   `drivenIdleMinutes` is closed the same way (`idle-closed`); the next instruction opens it again
//   with --resume (`held reopened`). A process that writes nothing within `drivenStartSeconds` of an
//   instruction is ended as stuck; one that ends by itself is `released crashed`, its turn `failed`.
//   A working turn is never cut short: stopping is the person's to do.
// - At most `drivenPerProject` held sessions per project on the machine (sessions opening and takes
//   about to open count too); a start or reopen past it is refused `cap-reached` with the limit.
// - The runner's restart: a session whose process an earlier run left is ended by the registry
//   (`restore`, under the runner's lock), listed in `holding` as not held, and opened again with
//   --resume on the next instruction (`held restored`).
// - Only the runner's own person acts: every request whose `by` isn't the account the runner links
//   as is refused `not-owner`, and for an existing session `by` must be the person who started it.
//   A session is acted on only through the office it was started through.
// - Everything built from the session (a reply, a tool's name and summary, the words for a tool that
//   wasn't allowed, an output) passes the secret scan first. A matched reply or output is sent as a
//   note with a `withheld` id, and only the owner's `release` sends it, as the runner's withheld
//   answers are released (runner.ts); a tool use whose name or summary matched is sent as `tool`,
//   with no summary, and a tool that wasn't allowed as "a tool". A prompt whose tool name matched
//   goes as `tool`, and one whose description matched with a description that only says so, both
//   `withheld`; neither is released. At most MAX_HELD are held, the oldest dropped, each cut to what
//   its release sends.
// - Every message is cut to the protocol's limits and checked against DrivenMessageSchema before it
//   goes, so one bad message can't make the server close the runner's link, and is sent only while
//   the office's link is up (`office.send`) and its connection's first `drive-policy` has come,
//   never kept in the reply outbox. A server that drives sessions sends that first on every
//   connection; one from before driven sessions sends none, and closes the link on a `driven` (#58),
//   so it is sent none. Until then a message is dropped, an answer to a drive request too, as one is
//   while the link is down. With the connection's first drive-policy, `holding` says where each of
//   the office's sessions stands; a later one on it doesn't send it again.
// - A handoff taken as a driven session (handoff/take.ts, mode `driven`): `takeProblem` before
//   anything is made, `prepareTake` once the worktree is ready (the cap), and `taken` once the take
//   has ended. When its `taken` was handed to the link (which sends it now, or after the next hello)
//   and the server hadn't dropped the take, nor the runner given it up, that opens it under the
//   take's uuid with the take's prompt as its first turn, named by that uuid, after `held`
//   `started`; otherwise it only frees the take's place under the cap.
// - Permissions (#42, design R2): a session runs in Claude Code's `auto` mode, or in
//   `bypassPermissions` when its person asked for that (the start's or the driven take's
//   `permissions`, kept in the registry as `asked` for a reopen or restore) and the latest
//   `drive-policy` on the current connection to its office lists its project. Before one arrives on a
//   connection, and from the link's drop until the next one, nothing opens with bypassPermissions.
//   A start asking for it where it isn't allowed is refused `bypass-off`; a take, reopen or restore
//   opens in `auto` all the same, its `held` says so, and an `error` says why. A drive-policy that no
//   longer lists the project of a session running in bypassPermissions ends its process at once, as
//   a stop does, with an `error` saying why and `released` `stopped`; the next instruction opens it
//   in `auto`. A link drop alone ends nothing: it doesn't change the admin's choice.
// - Whatever the mode, what still asks permission comes to the runner (`--permission-prompts host
//   --permission-prompt-tool stdio`, see the probe above) and goes to the floor as `prompt`, under
//   the runner's own id, with a plain description of what it asks (`promptDescription`) and
//   `expires`, `drivenPromptMinutes` on. Only the owner's `answer` naming a prompt still waiting
//   allows or denies it; with none by `expires` it is denied, `timed-out`. A stop, a hand-back, the
//   process ending or Claude Code cancelling it ends it `cancelled`. Each ends once, with
//   `prompt-ended`, and Claude Code gets an answer for each it still waits on; a `control_request`
//   that isn't a prompt gets an error at once, so a turn never waits on one. No idle close or
//   stuck timeout runs while one waits. With each connection's first drive-policy the waiting ones
//   go again, right after `holding`, unchanged; while the link is down they aren't kept anywhere else.
