// rooms from a fork of the room's lead (src/runner/runner.ts).
//
//   node <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/app/dist/runner.mjs --claude-dir <claude dir>             the supervisor
//   node <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/app/dist/runner.mjs --claude-dir <claude dir> --worker    the worker, which the supervisor starts
//
// Without --claude-dir the config folder is $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR or ~/.claude, as Claude Code's own.
// A folder other than ~/.claude is set as CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, so the fork finds its sessions there.
//
// It runs from a copy install makes (src/install), not from the plugin's own folder, which a
// plugin update deletes. The copy holds the defaults it reads beside it: config.json, runner.json,
// secret-patterns.json and prompts/.
//
// Install, the plugin's data layer and the wake hook start the supervisor, detached (start.ts). It
// takes <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/lock.json, so a second one exits at once, writes the code it
// runs into it and keeps it fresh, and runs the worker, starting it again after a crash
// (lifecycle.ts). After MAX_FAST_FAILURES quick crashes in a row it gives up and lets the lock go.
// The worker holds one link to each office server in config.json (#105), opened with a runner hello
// carrying the machine's pairing token with that server when it signs people in, under the machine's
// Claude account (src/data-layer/pairing.ts; a link to approve goes to the log, and the data layers
// show the same one in Claude Code), and stays up while any session on the machine is inside its
// lights-off window. Each office's link answers for that office alone: only for sessions in a repo
// it takes, from the same list the data layers read (src/data-layer/approved.ts). The forks, their
// cap (`maxForks`, one for the machine), the ledger and its caps are shared by every office. When a
// server doesn't want this machine's runner, or says its pairing has ended, only that office's link
// closes, and opens again later (offices.ts); a runner none wants holds off starting again for
// HOLD_OFF_MS. The worker exits when its supervisor has gone too, since its stdin closes then, and
// ends its forks as it goes.
//
// Its settings are runner.json, overridden per key by ~/.claude/isoplan/runner.json; the secret
// patterns are secret-patterns.json plus ~/.claude/isoplan/secret-patterns.json. Its ledger of
// answers is <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/ledger.json, and it logs to
// <claude dir>/isoplan/logs/runner.log.
//
// The worker reports every Claude Code session on the machine that no hooks module reports
// (reporting.ts, ADR 0007): headless ones, those it drives, and those without the plugin, each on a
// link of its own to each office, as a data layer would, sharing the runner's pairing and list.
//
// The worker also drives its person's sessions from the floor (session.ts; its hello says `drive`),
// for every office through one driver, and records every process it starts for that, and every
// fork and take into the Claude app's first turn, in <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/processes.json
// (registry.ts). As it starts, under the runner's lock, it ends what an earlier run left there that
// is verifiably Isoplan's, keeping driven sessions to open again. It doesn't stop for lights-off
// while a driven session's process runs, or while `startAtLogin` is on: then a person who works only
// on the floor keeps a runner up.
