// The runner reports every Claude Code session on the machine (ADR 0007): headless ones, those the
// runner drives from the floor, sessions without the plugin, and those whose hooks module is
// connected to the runner's pipe (src/pipe). It looks at <claude dir>/projects every `streamSeconds`,
// and reports each session in its own process (report-session.ts), one link per session to each
// office.
//
// A session whose hooks module is connected (`hooked`) is reported for that hooks module as soon as
// its transcript is there, however long ago it was written, and as long as the connection lasts.
// When the session's hooks module connects, changes (another window, a reload) or goes, the report
// under way stops and the session is reported again for the one it has now (`rehook`); with none,
// only once its transcript moves, so a session with the plugin that closes goes unreachable, as
// before. A hooks module's report that ended by itself (the plugin turned off, say) starts again
// once the transcript moves.
//
// Any other top-level transcript written within `idleMinutes` (on its first look, within
// `lightsOffHours`, so a runner just started fills the office back in) is reported without a hooks
// module. On its first look none starts before twice `runnerRetrySeconds` has passed: the hooks
// modules of a runner that started again say hello within one, and their sessions are reported for
// them from the start, not without them first. Not while the transcript names no folder yet or the folder has gone, or while Claude Code
// lists the plugin as uninstalled or disabled for the folder.
//
// Either way, not while the session's lock in <claude dir>/isoplan/live names another live process
// that keeps it fresh: the data layer process of an earlier version of the plugin, for a session
// still on that version; except one a hooks module's report takes the lock over from (takesOver in
// report-session.ts), and one that lets it go is reported for its hooks module at the next look. The runner counts a lock as fresh for three of its own slowest passes
// (lockFreshMs, from its config.json).
//
// A session it stopped reporting without a hooks module (quiet past `idleMinutes`, nothing to
// report, its link down five minutes, or an earlier version's data layer took its lock over) is
// reported again once its transcript moves; one it found such a data layer reporting, once its
// transcript moves after a look that found the lock let go, even when its last write and its lock
// letting go fall between two looks. One that ended with a hold-off (no office
// wants its project, git can't place its folder, or no office takes its repo) isn't reported again before the hold-off ends; one no office took is,
// as its transcript moves, once a fresh copy of one office's list takes one of its repos: only of an
// office it reported to or that config.json names now, never of one that didn't want it. The
// offices that didn't want it are left alone, each until its own hold-off ends. The hold-offs live
// here, in the runner's memory: a runner started again asks each office afresh.
