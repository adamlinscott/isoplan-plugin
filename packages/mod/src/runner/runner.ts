// What the runner does with the office server's requests. A question (answer-question) or a brief
// (write-brief) is answered from a fork of the room's lead, through the answerer (answerer.ts):
//
// 1. One at a time per room: a request waits for the one before it in the same room to finish.
// 2. The lead: a session this machine doesn't have or doesn't report (`isReported`), a folder that
//    is gone or a lead mid-turn is refused `unavailable`. A compacted lead is answered, with a
//    note saying so. The server names the session, so this is what keeps it to this machine's rooms.
// 3. Caps (caps.ts): over one, it is refused `over-cap` with the cap's name. One that passes
//    reserves its estimate at once, so a request in another room counts it.
// 4. The fork answers, at most `maxForks` at once across rooms; the rest wait their turn, and a
//    request's timeout runs from when its fork starts. The reservation is settled to what the fork
//    used, or taken back when no fork could be started.
// 5. The secret scan (scan.ts): a match is refused `withheld` and the reply is held; the owner's
//    `release` sends it. A release that arrives while its request is still running is applied
//    when the reply lands. Held replies are kept in memory, at most MAX_HELD, so a release after a
//    restart, or after its reply was dropped to make room, is refused with the reason.
//
// Nothing from the fork's output, or from the machine's folders, leaves without the scan: an
// `unavailable` refusal says only what kind of problem it was, and the details go to the local log.
//
// A request id seen before isn't run again: one still running is left to finish, and one that
// finished gets the same answer again, so a server that asks twice doesn't pay twice.
//
// A brief (#48) is asked for with the session's untracked files named (`prepareBrief`), and ends
// with the runner's note of what was pushed. When the fork can't write it (it failed, or a cap is
// reached), the reply still goes, marked `fallback` (and with the `cap`, when one is why), with the
// note alone, and the server writes the rest from the room's feed. Its branch is pushed (`push`)
// only once the brief has cleared the scan or been released. The push scans what it would send: on
// a match nothing is pushed, the refusal is `withheld` naming the files, in every repo (never the pattern), and the files it couldn't read, and the owner's
// release pushes that exact commit anyway. A push that fails is refused `unavailable` with the
// reason. Without `push` a write-brief is refused before the fork runs. A `drop` of a request still
// waiting in its room's line, or for a fork, takes it out: it never runs, and its estimate is never
// reserved, or is given back. Otherwise a `drop` ends a request: what
// is held for it goes, and one still running neither pushes nor sends. A handoff to take goes to
// `take`, with how to open its session; each take (the session id the server chose) runs once, however
// often it is sent, and what it did goes back as `taken`. owner-answer requests go to the live session, not
// the runner (#50).
