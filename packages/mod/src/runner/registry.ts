// The process registry (#41, design R1 and R4): <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/processes.json, this machine's
// one record of the processes Isoplan's runner started that may still be running, and of the
// sessions driven from the floor that it may open again. Only the runner's worker writes it; a
// separate app may read it (R4), so its format is stable and has a version:
//
//   {
//     "about": "...",
//     "version": 1,
//     "runner": <pid of the worker that wrote it>,
//     "written": "<ISO time>",
//     "processes": [
//       {
//         "kind": "driven" | "fork" | "desktop-read",
//         "pid": <pid> | null,         null: a driven session with no process now
//         "spawned": "<ISO time>" | null,   when the runner started that pid
//         "session": "claude-code:<uuid>",
//         "folder": "<the folder it runs in>",
//         "started": "<ISO time>",     when Isoplan first started a process for it
//         "lastActivity": "<ISO time>",
//         "state": "working" | "idle" | "closed",
//         "driven": { "room", "project", "office", "owner", "permissions", "transcript", "addDir"?, "name"? }   driven only
//       }
//     ]
//   }
//
// `driven` (a session driven from the floor, session.ts), `fork` (a fork of a room's lead answering a
// question or writing a brief, claude.ts) and `desktop-read` (a take into the Claude app reading the
// brief, handoff/take.ts). A fork or a first turn is there while it runs; a driven session stays
// after its process ends (closed when idle, stopped, crashed, or ended at a restart), for the next
// instruction to open again, until it is handed back.
//
// A pid alone doesn't name a process: after a reboot, or long enough, another process may have it.
// So a process counts as Isoplan's only while its pid is alive, the OS says it started within
// SPAWN_MATCH_MS of the `spawned` time recorded, and its command line names the session's uuid
// (every one of these runs `claude ... --resume <uuid>` or `--session-id <uuid>`). Nothing else is
// ever ended. On Windows the OS is asked through PowerShell's Win32_Process (hidden); elsewhere
// through `ps -o etime= -o command=`.
//
// At its start the worker reads the file (`restore`), which it does only under the runner's lock,
// as the supervisor took it: each recorded process that is still Isoplan's is ended with its process
// tree (a fork or a first turn whose runner is gone has no one to answer to; a driven session's
// process is ended so this runner can hold it), driven sessions are kept with no process, to be
// opened again with --resume, and the rest is dropped. Every write goes to a file beside it, then is
// renamed over it, so a reader never sees half a file. As the worker exits it writes, at once, that
// none of its processes runs any more (`closeSync`).
