// The supervisor writes `{ pid, code }` into the lock and keeps it fresh every LOCK_REFRESH_MS, so a
// lock not written for RUNNER_FRESH_MS is stale even when its pid is live: after a reboot the pid
// may name another process, which must neither count as the runner nor be killed. `code` names the
// runner.js it runs (its size and write time): a runner running older code than the recorded one
// (a plugin update copied a new one) is stopped and a new one started in its place.
//
// A supervisor that stops for a reason a restart won't mend (the server doesn't want it, it kept
// crashing) leaves a hold-off, `{ pid: 0, until, reason, code }`, which keeps it from starting
// until then.
