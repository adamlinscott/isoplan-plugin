// Asking the room for a session, as the runner does it when the session's ask_room script asks
// through the runner's pipe (main.ts, src/pipe/server.ts): it asks in the office the session took
// its handoff through (handoff/taken-office.ts) when that is one of those that gave the session its
// rights (`servers`, #105), else in the first of them in config.json's order whose list takes the
// session's repo; with none named, in the first office of all whose list does. It speaks to the
// office server as that session, on a short link of its own (handoff/connection.ts), and asks the
// room that session's person was handed (ask.ts). The server decides whether they may.
//
// When the office signs people in, the hello carries this machine's pairing token, as a session's
// link does (data-layer/pairing.ts). A token past its time is renewed with the machine's credential,
// and a hello refused as `token-expired` is sent once more with a fresh one. It never pairs the
// machine itself: with no credential it sends no token, and the session's status line shows the
// link to pair. Refused as not paired, ended or forged, the agent is told so plainly (ask.ts).
