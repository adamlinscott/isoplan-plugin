// Asking the room (#49), as the receiver's agent does it through the plugin's ask_room tool: the
// question goes to the office server on the session's short link, and the answer comes back from
// the fork of the room's lead on its owner's machine. It never blocks the session for long (#45):
// it polls askPolls times, askPollSeconds apart (runner.json, with the caps), and the server's own
// news of the question cuts a wait short. However runner.json is set, the whole wait, the ask and
// every check included, fits in MAX_WAIT_MS, well under the ten minutes Claude Code gives a
// command the hooks module runs. With no answer by then, the agent is told to carry on: the question stays queued on
// the server, and its end reaches the agent later as a note on one of its next tool results
// (hooks/register.ts). An end shown here is acked (asked-ack), so the server doesn't send it again.
//
// `key` is the tool call's own id: sent again, the ask is the same question, so a retry after a
// lost reply never asks twice.
