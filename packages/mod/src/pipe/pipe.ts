// The local pipe between the machine's runner and the sessions' hooks modules (ADR 0007 step 2):
// one per user per machine, served by the runner's worker (server.ts). On Windows it is a named
// pipe, on macOS and Linux a Unix socket in a folder only this user can open, <claude dir>/isoplan/
// pipe/; either way its name is new for each worker, so a worker that stops never takes the next
// one's away. The worker writes where it is, with a token it makes as it starts, to <claude dir>/
// isoplan/runner/pipe.json, which only this user can read (the user's own profile on Windows, mode
// 0600 elsewhere), and every message to the runner carries that token, so a process of another
// user can't use the runner's pipe.
//
// On Windows any user can list pipe names, and can make a pipe under a name pipe.json still names
// once its worker has gone (Windows lets other users only read the runner's own pipe, not write to
// it). So the runner proves it knows the token before it is sent anything: a client's first line is
// a `hi` with a new nonce, the runner answers with the nonce's HMAC under the token (`proof`), and a
// client drops a pipe that doesn't (openPipe).
//
// Each side writes one JSON object per line. A hooks module's end (client.ts, `dist/pipe.js`) says
// hello for its session and is sent that session's lines (src/lines.ts); the ask_room script
// (src/ask/main.ts) asks once and is sent the answer.
