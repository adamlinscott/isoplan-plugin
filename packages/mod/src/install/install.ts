// Installs the wake hook (src/wake), and takes it out again. The plugin's data layer installs it
// whenever it starts; the install script (main.ts) does the same without a session.
//
// The hook script is copied to <claude dir>/isoplan/wake.mjs, a path that outlives plugin updates
// and their versioned cache folders, and wake.json beside it records where the current data layer
// and the machine's runner (src/runner) are. The runner is copied too, into
// <claude dir>/isoplan/runner/app, with the defaults it reads beside it, for the same reason: a
// runner left running from a versioned folder would lose its files at the next update. A new copy
// replaces the running runner when it is next started (src/runner/start.ts). claude-binary.json
// records the `claude` binary the runner's fork runs, as `{ path, auto: true }`; one without
// `auto` was set by hand and is kept.
//
// settings.json gets one command hook on UserPromptSubmit and one on Stop. They are found again by
// this config folder's wake.mjs path in their command, not by a field of their own, which Claude
// Code's settings check might refuse; so an install updates them in place and never adds a second,
// and every other hook and setting is kept, another config folder's wake hook too, though the
// file's formatting comes back normalised (two-space JSON, no byte order mark). A settings.json
// that doesn't parse is left alone. Each file is written whole beside its target and moved over
// it, so neither Claude Code nor a running hook reads half of one.
//
// Uninstalling takes out everything install and the plugin put in place: the running runner, the
// plugin's files under <claude dir>/isoplan, and last the hooks, so a stop part way never leaves
// settings.json naming a wake.mjs that has gone. The files a person writes there are kept:
// config.json, runner.json, secret-patterns.json, and a claude-binary.json set by hand. The install
// script's uninstall leaves wake.json as `{ "disabled": true }`, so the plugin, if it is still
// installed, doesn't put the hook back when its data layer next starts; only the install script
// takes that away.
//
// Claude Code runs nothing of a plugin's when it is uninstalled, so the wake hook is what notices
// (src/wake/main.ts, with state.ts) and runs the same uninstall in the background. That one asks
// before each step whether the plugin is still uninstalled, and stops if it was installed again;
// and the hooks stay while a session wrote its files again during the wait, so a later prompt
// tries once more.
