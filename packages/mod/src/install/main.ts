// The install script: puts the wake hook in Claude Code's user settings without a session, as the
// plugin's data layer does when it starts, or takes out everything install and the plugin put in
// place (install.ts), leaving wake.json marking the hook as uninstalled, so the plugin's data layer
// doesn't put it back. It also records the `claude` binary and starts the machine's runner
// (src/runner), with an environment recorded from this shell: the runner answers for the machine's
// rooms, and as it starts reports every session written inside the lights-off window, so running
// install again fills the office back in.
//
//   node dist/install.js [--uninstall]
//
// The config folder is $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR when it is set, else ~/.claude, as Claude Code's own.
