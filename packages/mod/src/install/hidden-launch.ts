// Running node with no window on Windows, for what Windows itself starts: an isoplan:// link
// (link-handler.ts) and the login item (login-item.ts). node.exe is a console program, so Windows
// gives it a console window of its own when it starts it straight from a registry command. Instead
// Windows starts wscript.exe, which has no console, on a small JScript file that starts node with
// window style 0 (hidden) and doesn't wait for it. Probed on Windows 11 (26200): node started that
// way ran with no window, saw the link it was given in its environment unchanged (`%41` stayed as
// it was), and wscript exited 0.
//
// The launcher is pure ASCII: wscript reads a .js file with no byte-order mark in the computer's
// ANSI code page, so a path such as C:\Users\José written as UTF-8 reaches node garbled. Probed on
// Windows 11 (26200), in a folder named "José 张": a launcher with the paths as raw UTF-8 started
// nothing, and wscript still exited 0; the same launcher with them as \uXXXX escapes ran.
//
// //E:JScript names the engine, which wscript otherwise picks by the file's extension, through the
// .js file association, which another program may have changed. Probed: a launcher with an
// extension that has no engine made wscript exit 1 and run nothing; the same file with //E:JScript ran.
//
// Windows Script Host can be turned off by policy, and wscript then shows a message instead of
// running anything, so `scriptHostOff` is checked each time, before a registration through it is
// kept or made.
