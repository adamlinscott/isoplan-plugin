// The claude-code source: turns the transcripts Claude Code already writes into one session's

// reports, and what each one is doing now. It reads only the session it was started for: each
// session reports itself (#6), so no other session's transcript is ever opened.
//
// The transcript format is internal and undocumented, so every assumption about it lives in this
// one file (see docs/designs/agent-office-transcript-probe.md for where each field was found).
// A format change should be a one-file fix here, reported as a status rather than a crash.
//
// Ids are source-scoped: the session is claude-code:<session id>, its lead claude-code:<session
// id>:lead, and a subagent claude-code:<agent id>.
