// Reporting one Claude Code session: the data layer's loop, which the machine's runner runs in its
// own process for every session on the machine (src/runner/reporting.ts, ADR 0007), two ways: for a
// session whose hooks module is connected to the runner's pipe (src/pipe), `by: "hooks"`, and for one
// without, `by: "runner"`. What follows says "the data layer" for both.
//
// Every `streamSeconds` it reads the session's facts from its transcripts and hands them to the
// link, which holds the WebSocket to the office server. For a hooks module it emits JSON lines
// (src/lines.ts), which go down the pipe: the link's state, the server's notes, and room titles to
// write. It reports a hooks module's session until that hooks module's connection goes (`closed`),
// or another reports it. Each agent's report is
// secret-checked before it is sent, and one that matches is held until its owner releases it
// (src/data-layer/reports.ts). Only a session in a repo the office takes is reported: the data layer
// reads the office's list of repos (src/data-layer/approved.ts) and opens no link for any other,
// sending nothing of it, its hello included, and says so in the status line. An office server that
// signs people in wants the machine paired first: reading that list pairs it, keeping the credential
// in <claude dir>/isoplan/pairing.json, under the machine's Claude account (src/data-layer/pairing.ts).
// For a hooks module it keeps the plugin up to date (src/update): as it starts and every
// `updateCheckHours` it installs a newer version in the background, and once one is on disk it says
// so in the status line, since the session loads it only at /reload-plugins. The copy it goes by is
// the hooks module's (`root`).
// An agent's open question to its owner is reported too, secret-checked like a report, and
// answerable from the floor while the session's hooks module marks that it waits for it
// (src/data-layer/owner-answers.ts); without a hooks module they are read-only. The session fact
// carries the session's context window once its hooks module has written the size to the file the
// `window` line names; without one there is none. A Claude Code workflow's name,
// description, phases and agents' labels are secret-checked too, and one that matches goes out as a
// placeholder (src/data-layer/workflows.ts); its agents' results are reports like any other.
// For a hooks module that can submit a prompt (`takesMessages`), the session fact says
// `takesMessages`, and a message its owner sends from the floor goes to that hooks module, which
// submits it as the session's next turn (src/data-layer/owner-messages.ts).
//
// Its log lines go to <claude dir>/isoplan/logs/<session>.log (the runner's sessionLog), and without
// a hooks module the other lines are dropped. Without one it reports only while the session is at work, and the
// runner starts it again once the session's transcript moves: it ends once the session has been
// quiet longer than `idleMinutes`, once its link has been down five minutes in a row
// (src/data-layer/detached.ts), once the session has nothing to report, or when the server says the
// project isn't wanted. Started before the session's transcript has anything to report, it waits up
// to `factsWaitSeconds` for it first. Each way it ends is said in its log (#92). It can't watch the
// session's own process, so a closed session shows as quiet until it ends, then unreachable.
//
// It reports to every office server config.json names (#105): each has its own pairing, its own
// copy of the office's list, its own link, opened only while that office takes the session's repo,
// and its own hold on reports, which a release on that office's floor lets out to it alone. Each
// office's list is checked at once with the others', and a pass waits for a slow one at most
// `streamSeconds`, so one office's failure, pairing link, list or slowness never touches another's.
// The facts are read once a pass and go to each of those links; what the hooks module is sent names
// the office, and an office shows in the status line only once it is known to take the repo (or
// waits to be paired). Without a hooks module, a session one office doesn't want, while no office takes the
// repo, ends with a hold-off naming that office (`Ended`), which the runner keeps (reporting.ts).
// The runner gives it its own pairing and list for each office, so a machine pairs once per office.
//
// The runner reports a session once, with the hooks module the pipe has registered for it, if any
// (src/pipe/server.ts decides between two windows). It still takes <claude dir>/isoplan/live/
// <session>.json (src/wake/lock.ts) and refreshes it each pass, only so the data layer process of an
// earlier version (a session still on an older copy of the plugin) and the runner never report one
// session at once. Without a hooks module the lock says `detached`, and it doesn't start while such
// a data layer holds a fresh lock (three of its own slowest passes, lockFreshMs, from its
// config.json). For a hooks module it writes the lock as that hooks module's copy's data layer would
// have (its dist/data-layer.js, `detached: false`, when its window started, and a live parent), the
// shape an earlier version's data layer gives a session up to: so after a /reload-plugins, the new
// hooks module's report takes the lock over from the old version's data layer (takesOver), which
// leaves the session to it. Either way it ends as soon as such a data layer takes the lock back,
// telling a hooks module it reported for that it is `superseded` (`earlier`).
