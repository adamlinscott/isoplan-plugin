// Which repo an edit, a read or a command lands in (#74), so the floor can show an agent working in
// another repo there. Home is the session's folder: a file in a repo inside it is home, whichever
// repo that is (a workspace folder holding several repos stays one room); a file in a repo outside
// it is away. The session's own project, reached through another worktree or a second clone with
// the same remote, is the session's own: no project is named for it.
//
// A file is credited to the innermost repo it is in, whatever folder the call was made from: git
// is asked once, at the file's nearest folder that exists (so a file not written yet is placed
// too), and remembers the answer. Paths are compared after symlinks are resolved, as git reports
// its top level resolved.
//
// What is worked out here never leaves the machine by itself: `forOffice` keeps a file, command or
// subagent's checkout in another repo only when the server's office holds that repo and the server
// said it reads them.
